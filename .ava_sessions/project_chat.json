      "text": "Objective: Create a Python backend using the FastAPI framework. This backend will power a specialized tennis LLM. It will use Gemini 1.5 Flash with Tool Calling to answer user queries by calling a specific tennis API. It should also include a fallback web search function for cases where the API fails or lacks the requested information.\n\n1. Project Structure & Dependencies\nLanguage: Python\nFramework: FastAPI\nMain File: main.py\nDependencies: Create a requirements.txt file with the following libraries:\nfastapi\nuvicorn\ngoogle-generativeai\nrequests\npython-dotenv\nEnvironment Variables: Create a .env file to store GEMINI_API_KEY and RAPIDAPI_KEY.\n\n2. FastAPI Server Setup\nIn main.py, create a basic FastAPI application.\nImplement a single POST endpoint at /api/chat.\nThis endpoint will receive a JSON body with one field: query (the user's question).\nIt will process the query using the Gemini model and return a JSON response with one field: response (the model's final answer).\n\n3. Defining the Tools for Gemini\nThis is the core of the application. Define a set of functions that the Gemini model can call. Each function should have a very clear docstring explaining its purpose and parameters, as the model will use this information to decide which tool to use.\nHere are the primary tools based on the provided API documentation.\nTool Definitions:\nget_scheduled_events(date: str): \"Fetches all scheduled tennis events for a specific date. Use this to find out who is playing on a given day. The date must be in 'YYYY-MM-DD' format.\" \nget_live_events(): \"Fetches all currently live tennis events. Use this for questions about matches happening right now.\" \nget_odds_by_date(date: str): \"Fetches betting odds for all tennis events on a specific date. The date must be in 'YYYY-MM-DD' format.\" \nget_event_statistics(event_id: str): \"Fetches detailed statistics for a specific tennis event using its unique event ID. To get an event_id, you must first find the event using get_scheduled_events or get_live_events.\" \nget_player_performance(player_id: str): \"Fetches the recent performance and match history for a specific player using their unique player ID.\" \nget_h2h_events(player1_name: str, player2_name: str): \"Fetches the head-to-head match history between two tennis players. You will first need to find their IDs by searching for an event they are in.\"\nget_rankings(ranking_type: str): \"Fetches the official tennis rankings. The 'ranking_type' must be either 'atp' for men's rankings or 'wta' for women's rankings.\" \nFallback Tool Definition:\nweb_search(query: str): \"Performs a web search for general tennis information that the primary API cannot provide or when an API call fails. Use this as a last resort for player stats, tournament history, or news.\"\n\n4. Main Application Logic in /api/chat\nThe endpoint should execute the following sequence:\nInitialize Gemini: Configure the Gemini client using the API key from environment variables. Select the gemini-1.5-flash-latest model and pass it the list of tools defined above.\nFirst LLM Call: Send the user's query to the Gemini model.\nTool-Use Handling:\nInspect the model's response. If the model wants to call a function (like get_scheduled_events), the response will contain a function_call.\nIf a function_call exists:\nExecute the corresponding Python function (e.g., get_scheduled_events) using the arguments provided by the model. This function will use the requests library to hit the tennisapi1.p.rapidapi.com endpoint specified in the documentation, passing the RAPIDAPI_KEY in the headers.\nError Handling: If the API call returns an error (e.g., status code 4xx or 5xx), execute the web_search tool as a fallback.\nSecond LLM Call: Send the result from your tool (either the API data or the search results) back to the Gemini model.\nThe model will then use this data to generate a final, natural-language answer.\nReturn Response: Return the model's final text response to the user. If the model answered directly without using a tool, return that initial response.",
